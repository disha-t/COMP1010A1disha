## Worth 10% of your final marks

## Previewing .md files

Use the preview icon (with the magnifying glass) towards top right of VS Code window to see the preview of these .md files. Alternatively, use Ctrl-Shift-V (Cmd instead of Ctrl on Mac).

## Domain

The assignment is a word-construction game. You complete the logic of the game, and the visuals are taken care of. Test cases are provided which will help you debug your code.

You need to work with Strings, lecture notes for which are provided under COMP1000 section at:

https://softwaretechnologymq.github.io/Strings

Here's a video on how to debug Java programs in Visual Studio Code

## Importing libraries

You can use any method that operates on String objects (as described in the lecture notes linked above). You cannot import any other libraries.

## Automarker

60 out of 100 marks for this assignment comes from testing. We have an automarker setup, where you can submit your `ToDo.java` file, and it grades it within an hour, gives you the mark and feedback, and also tells you if you broke any rules.
The automarker has some additional tests compare to the ones provided that are used to avoid students hard-coding solutions.

## Code Style

40 out of 100 marks for this assignment are based on code style. A code style guide and marking rubric can be found in `codeStyleGuide.md`.  

## Submission

Submit the file `ToDo.java` only by 23:55 Sunday 7th April. Late penalties are explained in the unit guide. 

## Academic Integrity

This is an individual assignment and the work that you submit should be yours and not collaboratively done, or done using Generative AI. Breaches of academic honesty are reported to the University Disciplinary Committee.

## Computing Drop-in Centre

Remember to go to the Computing Drop-in Centre for guidance with the content related to the assessment. So, while they won't directly help you with the assignment, they can help you with any of the content at https://softwaretechnologymq.github.io/Strings or any of the problems on the codingbat website linked on the lecture notes page.

## Test bugs/mistakes

As much as we like to make sure that our tests are correct, it is possible that there might be some bugs. Students who find bugs can report it by emailing me with subject "COMP1010 Assignment 1 - I (think I) found a bug!". You will be given 20 house points if there is a test bug that has not yet been reported.


## Any other questions

Please feel free to ask generic questions about the assignment on General Discussion Forums.
Please prefix the subject of such posts with "Assignment 1: " so we can easily filter them.

All the best!
